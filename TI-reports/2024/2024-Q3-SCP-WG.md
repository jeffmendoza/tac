# 2024 Q3 Securing Critical Projects WG

## Overview

Sub projects continue to run and make progress. Little to no progress on main
initiative of enhancing Critical Project Set with more information. Attendance
is low.

## Identifying Critical Projects

Addition of Metadata to Set:
- Metadata fields roughly scoped and defined.
- Consensus is still hesitant
- Work to enhance set is stalled

## Criticality Score

- Continues to run and recalculate scores
- Small calculation fixes

## Package Analysis / Malicious Packages

- Ingesting data from Reversing Labs
  - Worked through issues with NPM namespacing and broken RSS feed
- Working on formal definition of "Malicious Package"
  - Example: Is a reputation farming package malicious?
  - PR: https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages/pull/381
  - TAC Feedback appreciated, interested in doing a blog post

### Purpose

Open Source Software has long suffered from a "tragedy of the commons"
problem. Organizations large and small make use of OSS every day, but many
projects are struggling for the time, resources and attention they need.

This is a resource allocation problem - and we can help solve it together. We
need ways to connect critical projects we all rely on with organizations that
can provide them with support.
