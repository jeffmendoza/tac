# 2025 Q1 Securing Critical Projects WG

## Overview

Sub projects continue to run and make progress. Little to no progress on main
initiative of enhancing Critical Project Set with more information. Attendance
is low.

## Identifying Critical Projects

### Purpose

Open Source Software has long suffered from a "tragedy of the commons"
problem. Organizations large and small make use of OSS every day, but many
projects are struggling for the time, resources and attention they need.

This is a resource allocation problem - and we can help solve it together. We
need ways to connect critical projects we all rely on with organizations that
can provide them with support.

### Current Status

Discussions on:
- Metadata side: what to add to list
- Ideal north star of next iteration
- Front end / publishing list

### Up Next

TBD, no concrete plans

### Questions/Issues for the TAC

None

## Criticality Score

### Purpose

1. Generate a criticality score for every open source project.

1. Create a list of critical projects that the open source community depends
   on.

1. Use this data to proactively improve the security posture of these critical
   projects.

### Current Status

- Continues to run and recalculate scores
- Updates 1 to 2 times a month
- Tracking 500,000 projects

### Up Next

Continue running

### Questions/Issues for the TAC

None


## Package Analysis / Malicious Packages

### Purpose

The Package Analysis project analyses the capabilities of packages available on
open source repositories. The project looks for behaviors that indicate
malicious software:

- What files do they access?
- What addresses do they connect to?
- What commands do they run?

The project also tracks changes in how packages behave over time, to identify
when previously safe software begins acting suspiciously.

This effort is meant to improve the security of open source software by
detecting malicious behavior, informing consumers selecting packages, and
providing researchers with data about the ecosystem.

Malicious Packages is a collection of reports of malicious packages identified in
Open Source package repositories, consumable via the Open Source Vulnerability
(OSV) format.

### Current Status

- Formal definition of "Malicious Package" merged
- Malicious Package counts (Pull numbers from annual update) (current as 2025-01-17)
    - 2 crates-io
    - 18158 npm
    - 740 nuget
    - 8778 pypi
    - 807 rubygems

### Up Next

Interested in PyPi data

### Questions/Issues for the TAC

None
